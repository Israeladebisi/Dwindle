Death Forest
The morning started like any other. Aches and pains, and throbbing bruises covered part of the body that you can't even imagine how they got there. Still, wood needs to be gathered before the ember's of last night's fire fade too quickly. But unlike most mornings, it seems you have some company. A voice calls out to you from the dense woods and demands you drop your supplies and leave immediately.
Drop everything and run
Try and locate the voice
Attempt to reason with the voice
Pretend to follow instructions but double back
Dropping the mornings work and what food you brought with you, you take off away from the voice. After a ten minutes of running, you're confident they haven't followed you and you start heading back to your base.
Looking around, all you can make out are the many trees in the area. The movement isn't exactly subtle and a distinct sound of a gun being cocked is enough to send a flash of fear through you. Still, you hang onto what's left of your determination and slowly back away, leaving only half of your supplies. Something in your eyes must have been agreeable to the voice, because no shot comes. You make it back home with what supplies you can.
You begin to talk to the voice, trying to appeal to their emotions. After several tense moments of silence, you look around. Announcing your intent, you leave the area and head back home, either calling the voice on its bluff or successfully appealing to its morality.
You drop your stuff as instructed, and begin to walk away. Five minutes later, you've wound your way around, circling around in the hopes of getting the jump on the voice. Unfortunately, it seems whoever this is expected this and you feel a heavy crack of pain on the back of your head. You wake up a few hours later, a throbbing headache, but thankfully still alive.
